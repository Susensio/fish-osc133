# fish-osc133

This plugin introduces [OSC 133](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Per_Bothner/specifications/blob/master/proposals/semantic-prompts.md) escape sequences to your shell output to define input, output and prompt zones.

This is used by modern terminal emulators to provide functions such as folding, jumping, etc.

## Installation

```fish
$ fisher install acomagu/fish-osc133
```
